# Spotifyify
**A node web application capable of automatically migrating an Apple Music playlist to Spotify.**

Since as long as I can remember my brother has used Apple Music, which is by no means dramatically more expensive than Spotify, but a few bucks is a few bucks. He incessantly complained (maybe said something to me once or twice) about how no one he knows uses Apple Music and he spends more money for only a slightly better product. But he can't do anything about it because it would take so long to recreate all his playlists. My ears were hurting, so I made him this app to stop his whining. Please don't judge the aesthetic, this was a project with a pragmatic design :)

# How it works
Watch this youtube video to see my little demo of the app, and feel free to ask any questions about the code available here.
